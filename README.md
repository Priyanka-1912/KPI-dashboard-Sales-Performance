# KPI dashboard Sales Performance

## Project Overview
I developed this dashboard to provide a clear, visual snapshot of key sales metrics. It’s packed with interactive features that allow users to dive into the data, making it a powerful tool for decision-making. Whether it’s spotting top-performing products or understanding regional sales trends, this project reflects my passion for turning numbers into stories.

## Objective
My goal with this dashboard was to create a tool that empowers users to make informed decisions by tracking sales performance over time, highlighting top customers and products, and mapping sales across regions and cities. With metrics like Total Sales, Total Orders, and Sales Growth %, I aimed to build something practical yet insightful.

## Features
- **Total Sales**: Shows overall sales for March 2025 at a solid ₹2.25M—pretty impressive, right?
- **Total Orders**: Tracks 4,916 orders for the current period, giving a sense of our activity.
- **Average Order Value**: Highlights an average of ₹458,219 per order, reflecting strong transaction value.
- **Sales Growth %**: Captures a 2.77% growth rate—room to build on that!
- **Total Sales by Year**: A line graph showing the sales trend from 2015 to 2018, with a notable dip in 2016.
- **Sales by Top Product**: A pie chart breaking down top performers:
  - Canon ima: ₹19.82K (12.92%)
  - Fellowes: ₹21.87K (14.26%)
  - Cisco Tele: ₹22.64K (14.76%)
  - HON 54: ₹27.45K (17.9%)
  - GBC Do: ₹61.6K (40.16%)—a clear leader!
- **Total Sales by Top Customers**: A bar chart spotlighting key contributors:
  - Sean Miller: ₹25K
  - Tamara Chand: ₹19K
  - Raymond Buch: ₹15K
  - Tom Ashbrook: ₹20K

## Benefits
I’m proud of how this dashboard can make a difference:
- **Informed Decision-Making**: Real-time data helps users back up their instincts with facts.
- **Trend Identification**: The 2016 dip in the graph is a reminder to stay proactive.
- **Customer & Product Insights**: Focusing on stars like Sean Miller and GBC Do can drive success.
- **Geographical Optimization**: Maps show where to push harder, like North America and Europe.
- **Performance Monitoring**: The 2.77% growth is a benchmark to aim higher.
- **Efficiency & Scalability**: Interactive filters make it adaptable as the business grows.

## Conclusion
I believe this dashboard has real potential! Starting from ₹2.25M in sales and 2.77% growth, I see room for a business to grow revenue by 5-10% (₹112.5K-₹225K) with smart strategies, boost efficiency by 3-5%, and enhance customer value by 5-7%. Overall, I’d estimate a 10-20% improvement in the first year with the right follow-through. I’m excited to keep refining it!
